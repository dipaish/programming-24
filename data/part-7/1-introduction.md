GitHub is a web-based platform that serves as a powerful tool for programmers and developers. It acts as a central hub for storing, managing, and collaborating on code. One of GitHubâ€™s core features is **version control**, which allows you to track changes in your code, revert to previous versions, and collaborate seamlessly with others.

Think of GitHub as a shared workspace for coding projects. It enables individuals and teams to **upload, organize, and manage** their code efficiently. GitHub plays a significant role in **open-source development**, allowing developers worldwide to contribute to and improve software together.

If you are new to the concept of version control, please watch the introductory video below (approximately 7 minutes) to understand its importance.
