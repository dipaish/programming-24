## What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based platform that serves as a powerful tool for programmers and developers. It acts as a central hub for storing, managing, and collaborating on code. One of GitHubâ€™s core features is **version control**, which allows you to track changes in your code, revert to previous versions, and collaborate seamlessly with others.

Think of GitHub as a shared workspace for coding projects. It enables individuals and teams to **upload, organize, and manage** their code efficiently. GitHub plays a significant role in **open-source development**, allowing developers worldwide to contribute to and improve software together.

If you are new to the concept of version control, please watch the introductory video below (approximately 7 minutes) to understand its importance.

## Getting Started with GitHub

Once you have familiarized yourself with the basics, follow these steps:

### 1. **Sign up for a GitHub account**

If you already have a **GitHub account**, you can sign in and if you don't have one, you can create a new GitHub account by following the instructions below:

  1. Go to [GitHub Sign up Page](https://github.com/signup)
  2. Fill in the Sign Up form.
  3. Verify your Email address. GitHub will send a verification email to the email address you provided. Go to your email inbox, find the email from GitHub, and click the verification link.

> Congratulations! Once your email is verified, your account is ready. You can now start using GitHub to create repositories, contribute to projects and collaborate with others.

### 2. **Link your Laurea Email**
