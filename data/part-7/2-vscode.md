To work more effectively with GitHub, itâ€™s essential to integrate it with an IDE like **VS Code**. There are two ways to do this:

---

## Method 1:  Local Setup
This method involves installing Git on your local machine and using the **GitHub Pull Request and Issues extension** in VS Code.

### **Steps to Set Up Git with VS Code:**
1. **Install Git** (Version Control System)  (if not installed)
   - Download and install Git from [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
   - After installation, verify the installation by running:
     ```sh
     git --version
     ```

2. **Configure Git**

After installing Git, you need to configure Git by providing your full name and email address.You can start [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) (if you have it already installed in your personal device) and configure using the graphical user interface as shown in the diagram below **or use the command line**.

![Configure Git](configure2.png "Please use your Full Name and email ")

***Configure Git with command line***

1. Open Git Bash.
2. Set your username and email, which will be associated with your commits. Use these commands, replacing "Your Name" and "your.email@example.com" with your actual information:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email your.email@example.com
```
***Check your Git Configuration***

```bash
git config --list
```

3. **Install VS Code** (if not installed)
   - Download it from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

4. **Install GitHub Pull Request and Issues Extension**
   - Open VS Code and go to the **Extensions Marketplace** (`Ctrl + Shift + X` / `Cmd + Shift + X` on macOS).
   - Search for **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues** and install it.
   - Alternatively, install it directly from [VS Code Extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github).

5. **Authenticate GitHub in VS Code**
   - Open VS Code and navigate to:
     ```
     View > Command Palette (Ctrl + Shift + P / Cmd + Shift + P on macOS)
     ```
   - Search for **"GitHub: Sign in to GitHub"** and follow the prompts.

6. **Clone a GitHub Repository into VS Code**
   - Open VS Code and open the **Command Palette**.
   - Select **"Git: Clone"** and enter the repository URL from GitHub.  (Example Repo Link: https://github.com/Laurea-amk-Leppavaara/github-starter-space)
   - Choose a local folder to save the repository and start coding.

## Method 2: Using GitHub Codespaces (Cloud-Based IDE)
**GitHub Codespaces** is a cloud-based development environment that allows you to code directly in your browser without installing anything locally.

### **Benefits of GitHub Codespaces:**
- No installation required
- Access your code from any device
- Standardized development environment

### **How to Use GitHub Codespaces:**
1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Click the **"Code"** button and select the **"Codespaces"** tab.
3. Click **"New codespace"** to launch a fully configured VS Code environment in your browser.

**Watch this short video on how to use GitHub Codespaces:**

###  **Which Method Should You Use?**
- **Use the local method** if you prefer working locally and need **full control over your development environment**.
- **Use GitHub Codespaces** if you want to **code from anywhere** without worrying about installations.
