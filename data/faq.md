### I found a mistake in the course material or in a programming exercise

We would be very grateful if you'd let us know  via email to course maintainers at deepak.curator@gmail.com. Thank you!

### Why doesn't TMC show all parts of the course? How can I download the next part's exercises?

Next part's exercises can be downloaded once you've gained 25% or more of the previous part's exercise points.
