During this course, you will learn the basics of computer programming through Python.  The course is practically oriented and contains a lot of hands-on exercises.  **You can only learn to code by coding.**

The course is based on the programming MOOC (massive open online course) by the University of Helsinki which has been adapted for the needs of this course. The original course material is available [here](https://programming-24.mooc.fi/).
